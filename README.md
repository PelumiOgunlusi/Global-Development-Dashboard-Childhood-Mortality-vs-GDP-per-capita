# Global Development Dashboard: Childhood Mortality vs GDP per capita
This project provides an interactive dashboard to explore the relationship between childhood mortality rates and GDP per capita across different countries and over time. The dashboard is built using Quarto and leverages Python libraries for data manipulation and visualization.
The dashboard allows users to analyze trends in child mortality, compare GDP per capita across countries, and explore the relationship between these two critical indicators of global development.

## Features

- **Child Mortality Analysis:** Trends, country rankings, geographic distribution, and distribution histograms.
- **GDP per Capita Analysis:** Global trends, top/bottom countries, distribution, and choropleth mapping.
- **Relationship Exploration:** Interactive scatter plots, animated trends, correlation analysis, and outlier identification.
- **Summary Insights:** Key findings on global health and economic disparities.

## Data

- `data/gdp_pcap.csv`: GDP per capita by country and year.
- `data/child_mortality_0_5_year_olds_dying_per_1000_born.csv`: Child mortality rates by country and year.

## Usage

Open `final_project.qmd` in Quarto and render the dashboard. Requires Python, pandas, plotly, itables, and country_converter.
